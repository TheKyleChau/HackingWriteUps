Now that we have gotten the key from level 2.

You can now login into the third level!

Command Line:

ssh bandit2@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

Password: CV1DtqXWVFXTvM2F0k09SHz0YwRINYA9

After we get in, if we do the command "ls".

We can see that theres a file, but it has spaces in it.

How do we open it? By adding \ to the end of each word that has a space behind it.

So the command would go as follow.

cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename

And now we have our password!
