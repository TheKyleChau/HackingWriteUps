Day 1: Web Exploitation - Save The Gifts

So we're greeted with instructions for Save The Gifts.
The first step that we need to look at is the URL in the webpage given

https://website.thm/profile?id=23

^ is the example they give.

23 is the ID that is being queried.
So we need to try and exploit an IDOR vulnerability where you change the id parameter.
Changing the ID parameter will help us exploit the IDOR vulnerability as that's a parameter that we shouldn't be changing as a user.

We start to look at the website which starts us off on the Inventory Management Page which shows a bunch of toys that were mismade.
We're looking for the Your Activity page as we can see who changed that items.
If we try replacing the user_id value starting at 1, we can see that user_id 1 is Santa.
And if we keep going to 9, we can see that the Grinch is the user behind all the of actions.
As we revert them all, we get the flag.
