Day 2: Web Exploitation - Elf HR Problems

First, we're greeted with a big explaination on how cookies are stored when a HTTP request is made.
There is a lot to process as cookies can have so many components.
However, we can manipulate these cookies to give us access that was never supposed to be given.
If we open the website, we can see that we have to register an account.
After we register an account, it says that we don't have access.
However, if we open up Developer Tools in our browser and look at Cookies.
We can see that the value of the user-auth cookie is in Hexadecimal format.
After we try decoding hexadecimal format, we are left with a JSON type string.

I registered my username with test.
However, it will your username that you tried registering with.
So now, if we try replacing test with the username admin.

And we encode it back into hex.

We can now pose as an admin user.
Let's try pasting this into the value of the cookie user-auth and refresh the page.

Success! We are now in the admin page.
